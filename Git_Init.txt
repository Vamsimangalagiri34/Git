git init is used to initilize the directory we we use this cmd git will creates a .git folder inthe folder .

By default it may works on master branch but if we can to work on main branch we can use this cmd
git init -b main

git log it will show all the commits

HEAD is nothing but a pointer

the place where we are working is called working area

staging area is present in local rep (.git)
staging is a area where the files we add it will goes to there 
after commit it will goes to local commit

we can skip staging area By
git commit -a -m "msg"

we can come back to working area By
git rm --cached file_name

git diff command:

we change the code or file it get modified to check the previous and modified code we use cmd ( git diff ) it shows the what we changes done.
after that we if we want to send the code into staging area then we use --(git add filename )--

in working area if we want check diff  use git diff file_name.name 

we weedit the file than it will get modified there we need to check what we modified actually 
after add to staging area use --staged to check diff
for working area check git diff
if the code or file in staging area we can also check the diff by using cmd ---( git diff --staged)---
the file in staged area so we use --(git diff --staged)--
Hello World: The original content in the last commit.

+This is a new line: The new content staged for the next commit.
