Version control systems are essential tools for managing changes to code and files in software development. They can be categorized into two main types: Centralized Version Control Systems (CVCS) and Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS).

Centralized Version Control Systems (CVCS):

In a CVCS, there is a single central repository that contains all the versioned files. All users must interact with this central system for their changes.
its required internet and we dont have any copy 
we cant see all the commits

Advantages:
Easy to manage for small teams, as everyone can see what others are working on real-time.
Disadvantages:
If the central server goes down, all data may be lost, and users cannot work offline.
Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS):

In contrast, DVCS allows each user to have a complete local copy of the repository, including the entire history of changes. Popular examples include Git.
for pushing the commits we need internet even though without net we can work on the project and we have a copy in our local system and remote repo 
we can see all the commits 

Advantages:-
Users can work offline and have access to the full history of changes. Collaboration is easier since changes can be made independently and combined later.
Disadvantages:
Slightly more complex to understand and manage, especially for new users.
